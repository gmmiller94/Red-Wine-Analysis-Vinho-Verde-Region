Wine Quality Analysis of Vinho Verde Red Wines
&nbsp;  

:wine_glass: **Project Description** :wine_glass:

We all love wine, especially after a long day of negotiating with our kids and navigating tense meetings with our bosses. But what really makes the difference between a "high value" wine and the cheap bottle we buy at Walmart? Physiochemical properties and sensory tests are important to the overall analysis of evaluation for wine certification. Identifying the most influential factors in wine quality can improve wine making and help determine relative price points, differentiating the Monet type from the 5 year old finger painting type.

Due to the rarity of red wine produced in the Minho region, we look to focus our efforts exclusively on the Vinho Verde red portion of the data set of 1599 cases, which will further reduce to 1143 cases once the data is cleaned and wrangled. Through this process, we aim to build a successful model for evaluating which physicochemical properties have the most significant influence on the quality of wine. 

Our evaluation questions and links to analysis are as follows.

Evaluation question 1. Which physiochemical properties of wine have the most significant impact on quality?

Evaluation question 2. Having identified the physicochemical properties that significantly influence wine quality, how do they affect wine quality individually? (i.e., What balance or interplay between these variables is necessary for the best quality wine?

:wine_glass: **How to Use the Project** :wine_glass:

This project was an evaluation of the Vinho Verde Wines to understand what variables affected quality the most and what ratio of most effictive variables differentiate wine from being poor, average or good.
The data can be used for basic understanding of the ratio for the variables in the wine data set to how they affect quality, as well as which vaiables tend to affect quality the most.

Due to small sample size, the analysis of data may not be accurate in relation to actual quality of the wine. The data might be skewed due to previous cleaning of data from former user. Due to age of data, physiochemical properties might have changed. The classification is skewed due to inbalance, there are more normal wines than excellent or poor.
